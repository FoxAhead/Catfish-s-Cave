<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Progress on the War of the Ring scenario 
has been spasmodic as my interest in Civ2 waxes and wanes. I'm running only my 
5th playtest. The struggles continue with the AI and events space (see the 
comments below on delayed events).
</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I've added a graphics mod pack for ToT's 
Original game to the <a href="JP_MiscGraphics.htm">Miscellaneous Graphics</a> section. It was made a couple of 
weeks ago for an older person whose eyesight isn't exactly 100% and makes use of 
team colour masks. It's basically a compilation of user-made and Microprose material; the 
credits are in the Readme file. It won't be everybody's cup of tea. Take it or 
leave it.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The inclusion of animated terrain (which 
I'd always removed from my game) in the aforementioned mod pack exposed me to a 
bug whereby the animated terrain file, resource.spr, would interfere with 
scenarios lacking their own custom resource.spr file - even when  the 
Animated Terrain was turned off under the game's Graphic Options. See 
<a href="http://apolyton.net/forums/showthread.php?threadid=118766">this thread</a> at Apolyton for 
details. As a result I created a <a href="Files/Dummy_Resource.zip">dummy 
resource.spr</a> file which can (and should, in my opinion :)) be included with 
any ToT scenario to prevent  such interference. Most veteran gamers tend to 
ditch terrain animation by renaming the file, but new players won't. Oh and 
scenario designers should also avoid the animation lockout options in the Scenario Parameters list. They're 
useless and only impede a player's ability to adjust their settings to the 
correct ones.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none" align="justify"><font face="Arial">About Delay 
and DelayPerFlag modifiers:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none" align="justify"><font face="Arial">From my 
experience with these, my advice would be to use them sparingly and with 
caution. Each time a Delay or DelayPerFlag event is called, it is loaded into 
the memory space shared by all other events. Each delayed event takes up 276 bytes in 
the .sav file and requires 284 bytes in memory. Repeating Delay/DelayPerFlag 
events can very quickly eat up your remaining events memory as each stacks up an 
additional 284 bytes. To avoid problems with these modifiers in your scenario you'll need to calculate the maximum possible 
number of concurrent Delay/DelayPerFlag events and multiply this figure by 284. 
The resulting value must not exceed the remaining heap space, as calculated by the 
events debugger, otherwise there exists the potential for some delayed events to 
simply not load&nbsp; – although I guess if 
none of them are game critical, it may not matter.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Not having 
read the <i>entire</i> Macro.txt document for a few years, I discovered this the 
hard way (which includes plenty of obscene language). Shortly after figuring this out I stumbled on these lines at the end 
of the document: </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;In 
  addition, delayed actions (those using the DELAY modifier) create countdown 
  timers that also take up memory space. If your delays pile up and you run out 
  of memory because of it, the scenario won't crash, but any delayed actions 
  that don't fit in memory will not ever take place.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Sigh…</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none" align="justify">
<font face="Arial">Addendum (6/08/2004): Man, it certainly pays to read all of 
the text files, doesn't it? This time from the 1.1 patch readme:</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none" align="justify">
<font face="Arial">&quot;For events files, the Debug file (report.txt) now includes 
the amount of stack space left for your use. Please note, however, that this 
total does NOT include the stack space needed by DELAYed events. Each DELAY adds 
284 bytes to the space used. Overlapping DELAYs (those whose counters could be 
running at the same time) add up, but those that do not overlap do not-- i.e. 
they can re-use the same 284 bytes.&quot;</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none" align="justify">
<font face="Arial">This would have saved me a lot of grief. If there's any 
consolation, at least I know I was right on the money. :|</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">I’ve been working away on the War of the 
Ring 
scenario over the last few nights. My, isn’t fleshing out the describe.txt file 
an exciting task? Copying, pasting, scanning, typing, editing - 21 000 words and 
counting. I’m also fighting with the events file – fitting all of your events 
within the 104 kb allocated memory must be akin to trying to stuff a push bike 
into a Christmas stocking. However, the biggest problem with the scenario is the AI. 
Now, I’ve always known that the Civ2 AI was dumb, but trying to get it to jump 
through the hoops that are the impassable terrain barriers in this scenario is a 
nightmare. I’m having to divide the map into many MoveUnit cells, each of which 
directs traffic through the numerous choke points. Of course, each additional MoveUnit 
event  further reduces my available events space. Then there are those units which are independently assigned ridiculous 
GoTo 
orders that they can’t possibly hope to carry out. Whinge. Moan. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none" align="justify"><font face="Arial">In contrast 
to my gripes, I have to say that the Quest scripting works pretty well – an 
impossible task without Test of Time’s multiple maps and flags. These 
include the Barrow-downs upgrades, Rivendell and the Council of Elrond (Frodo’s 
arrival/non-arrival, upgrade and spawning of Fellowship members), Gandalf 
opening the Gates of Moria, Merry/Pippin rousing the Ents, Gandalf rousing 
Théoden, Aragorn and the Paths of the Dead, Gollum opening the way through 
Cirith Ungol and of course, the final event: destruction of the Ring in Mount 
Doom. Lórien (Elven boats and Sam upgrade) has a minor problem. I simply ran out 
of map transport relationships, so it’s possible (but very unlikely – I’ve made 
it difficult and unrewarding) to fire this trigger with inappropriate units.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Hmm, so what have I been up to in the realms of Civ2 over 
the last 3 months? Not much, I'm afraid. I was supposed to be working on my 
scenario, but only resumed work on the project yesterday. It was not long after 
my last site update that I let the cat out of the bag in one of the Civ2 forums 
regarding the project's nature. In February this year, I dusted off my old War of the Ring 
scenario, 
decided I didn't like the map and so started over again from scratch.&nbsp; I'll post a few screenshots in the Scenarios section - it may 
provide me with some additional motivation to get my arse into gear.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I've got my filthy mitts on a scanner of 
late and thought I'd take the opportunity to sample some of the newly available 
source materials for unit creation. A couple of WWII Brits was the result. 
They're intentionally smaller than my standard man-sized units; make them too 
large and they dwarf the armour.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Been working on various scenario stuff, both of a graphical and non-graphical 
nature. In the process, I'm trying not to get distracted by Boco's
<a href="http://apolyton.net/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=109766">beta 
release</a> of his superb El Aurens scenario. A lot of time and effort has been 
poured into this one, so get play-testing! Just to prove that I haven't been 
sitting on my hands, here's a screenshot of a revamped city screen for a ToT 
scenario of mine (66% 
of original size). The original city name and flag have been scrubbed.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="4">26/01/2004</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I was playing around with Test of Time's sprites and masks  
(courtesy of Mercator's CivSprite utility) and came up with 
the following results:</font></p>

<p align="justify">
<img border="0" src="Pics/ToTMasks.png" width="279" height="133"></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The  brightness and contrast of the unmasked area (greyscaled)  could 
probably be worked a bit (the mask layer, itself, is either on or off), but it 
was just an experiment. Not quite as good as the original (inset) but I still 
may consider its use for some generic units, such as this man-at-arms.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">This is my first attempt at anything 
website related, whacked together one night using FrontPage. Favouring 
functionality over design, it's really just a repository for my Civilization 2: Test of Time 
files - instead of having them scattered all over the Apolyton site. Here, I will post my 
graphics and scenarios (should I ever finish them and if they'll fit - I've got 
a 10 Mb limit).</font></p>
