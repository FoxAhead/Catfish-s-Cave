      <h1>Civilization II: Test of Time Installation Guide</h1>

      <p>Many classic games remain popular decades after their release. Fans keep them alive by fixing bugs, creating mods, and, importantly, maintaining compatibility with current operating systems. So how does the casual gamer keep track of all these changes, so that they may play the game with the best possible settings? That's what this guide is about.</p>

      <h2>Why the Test of Time version?</h2>

      <p>MicroProse released several versions of Civilization 2, beginning with the original (sometimes referred to as the classic) version in 1996. This was followed by the <i>Conflicts in Civilization</i> (CiC) and <i>Fantastic Worlds</i> (FW) expansions in 1997, and then the stand-alone <i>Multiplayer Gold Edition</i> (MGE) in 1998. The final version of the game, and what should have been the definitive version, <i>Test of Time</i> (ToT), was released in 1999. Unlike its predecessors, ToT was not well received. Why? Mostly for two reasons: firstly, it was created as a full-priced stand-alone game hot on the heels of MGE. Many argued that one new scenario, plus 3 mods didn't justify the price tag, particularly if they'd just forked out for MGE. Secondly, the graphics, by many people's reckoning, were awful: dark, drab and blurry. So why focus on this version? Because it's essentially <i>MGE Plus</i>. It is MGE with a better graphics engine (shame about the choice of artwork) and superior scenario design capability. So let's install the game, grab some mods and start playing Civilization 2.</p>

      <h2>Installation Steps</h2>

      <p>The following will provide step-by-step instructions on how to install, patch and modify the game to taste in Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8.</p>

      <div class="tipblock" id="GameInstall">
        <div class="blockheading">
          <h3>Step 1. Install the Game</h3>
        </div>
        <p>ToT will install on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8. Typically it does not require Windows Compatibility mode. The exact installation instructions will vary depending on which version of the game you have (original CD-ROM, <i>Civilization Chronicles</i> [2006], downloaded archive), so follow those that came with your game. A few suggestions:</p>
        <ul class="utilmenu">
          <li><p>Instead of installing the game in the default Program Files folder, <b>create a new folder called Games</b> (or some such) in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory">root directory</a> of your hard disk (eg, C:\Games) and install it there. Many old games, including <i>Civilization 2</i>, save data to their installation folder instead of the Documents folder in the user profile. The Program Files folder is often write protected against non-administrator accounts and this may prevent you from saving your games.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Avoid a long installation path</b>. This is especially applicable to those people with <i>Civilization Chronicles</i>. Its verbose installation path, when combined with scenarios bearing large folder names, may produce game crashes. Change the default path and shorten scenario folder names if necessary. ToT's file path limit is 113 characters. Anything over that and you're going to run into trouble. C:\Games\Test of Time is good.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Avoid irregular characters in the installation path</b>. Characters, such as full stops (periods), can produce in-game anomalies, eg, the disabling of some menus.</p></li>
          <li><p>If prompted to install DirectX 6 drivers, select <b>No</b>.</p></li>
          <li><p>If prompted to register the game with MicroProse, select <b>Cancel</b>, and <b>Never Register</b>.</p></li>
        </ul>
      </div><br>

      <div class="tipblock" id="TimeThreatParadox">
        <div class="blockheading">
          <h3>Step 2. Install the Official Time Threat Paradox Scenario (Optional)</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Skip this step if you have <i>Civilization Chronicles</i>; the scenario is included in the package. <i>The Time Threat Paradox</i> was a scenario released by MicroProse <i>before</i> the game was patched to version 1.1. The official patch also patches the scenario. If you wish to play this scenario, install it <i>before</i> anything else. The scenario pack can be downloaded from the following locations:</p>
        <ul class="totmenu">

        </ul>
      </div><br>

      <div class="tipblock" id="OfficialPatch">
        <div class="blockheading">
          <h3>Step 3. Install the Official 1.1 Patch (Essential)</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Download and install the correct language version:</p>
        <ul class="totmenu">
          <li><p><a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/downloads.php?do=cat&amp;id=101">Civilization Fanatics' Center</a> (English and German versions.)</p></li>

        </ul>
        <div class="tipblock_dark">
          <p>If you have the version of ToT that shipped with <i>Civilization Chronicles</i>, you may be unable to install the patch. You may be slapped with the following error message: 'You must have Civ II Test of Time installed in order to install this update.' The <i>Chronicles</i> installer fails to complete the necessary changes to the registry and the official patch installer can't detect the game.</p>		  
          <ul class="utilmenu">
            <li><p><b>Solution 1:</b> Try updating the game with SanMadJack's <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=8534">patch installer</a>.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Solution 2:</b> The missing registry entries can be patched in prior to running the official 1.1 patch installer. For this method, click on <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=233203">this link</a> and follow Mercator's instructions.</p></li>
          </ul>

      </div><br>

      <div class="tipblock" id="MidgardPatch">
        <div class="blockheading">
          <h3>Step 4. Install an Events Patch for the Midgard Game (Recommended, if you intend to play the Midgard scenario)</h3>
        </div>
		<p>The official Midgard scenario <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=382827">contains a few serious events errors</a> that prevent a player from achieving victory through the 10-quest path. I created a small patch for the scenario. <a href="files/Midgard_patch.7z">Download it</a> (27 kB) and extract the contents into your Midgard folder (it's inside your main ToT folder), overwriting the originals. Back them up first if you wish.</p>

		<p>Use an archiving program like <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> (freeware) or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a> (shareware) to extract 7Z files.</p>
      </div><br>

      <div class="tipblock" id="ToTPP">
        <div class="blockheading">
          <h3>Step 5. Install the Test of Time Patch Project (Recommended, Essential for 64-bit Windows)</h3>
        </div>
        <p>The <b>Test of Time Patch Project (ToTPP)</b> by TheNamelessOne is a reverse engineering mod that fixes bugs and adds new features to ToT. Included is a no-CD patch. Download and install the latest version (currently 0.15.1) from the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=517282">ToTPP thread</a> at CFC. Safe patches are enabled by default. I leave all of the default options enabled, with the exception of the throne room. Certain patch options may be required to play specific mods and scenarios; check their documentation.</p>
		    <p>If you have a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows">64-bit version of Microsoft Windows</a>, then the <b>Edit control (64-bit compatibility)</b> patch component of the ToTPP is an essential part of the installation.</p>
        <div class="tipblock_dark">
          <p><b>Note:</b> There is a bug associated with the ToTPP's movement multipliers in its optional @COSMIC2 section of the rules file. If this section is missing from the rules file (as is the case for all official games and pre-ToTPP scenarios), units may be provided with unlimited movement along roads and rivers. Those units with the alpine 'treat all squares as roads' flag may also possess unlimited movement.</p>
				  <ol class="utilmenu">
					  <li><p><b>Solution 1:</b> When playing any affected games, restart ToT and uncheck the 'Movement multipliers' box under <b>Features/Modifications</b> in the ToTPP Launcher's list of patches. Note that this patch may be required to play some scenarios specifically designed for use with the ToTPP.</p></li>
					  <li><p><b>Solution 2:</b> Add the following entries to the rules.txt file for the affected game or scenario:</p>
						    <blockquote class="textblock">
                @COSMIC2<br>
								RoadMultiplier, 1, 3<br>
                RiverMultiplier, 1, 3<br>
                AlpineMultiplier, 1, 3<br>
                RailroadMultiplier, -1
                </blockquote></li>
					  <p>If you are playing a custom scenario, check the value of the Road movement multiplier under the @COSMIC section in rules.txt. The default value is 3 and that's typical for most scenarios. If you find a different value, substitute that value for 3 in the lines above.</p>
  				</ol>

      <div class="tipblock" id="IndeoCodecs">
        <div class="blockheading">
          <h3>Step 6. Install Codecs for Video Playback (Essential)</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Playback of ToT videos requires the installation of the archaic Indeo 5 codec. No codec means black screens and/or hanging when the game attempts to launch a video. Here are three solutions in the order of my preference:</p>
				<ol class="utilmenu">
					<li><p><b>Solution 1:</b> This option is for those who elected to install the ToTPP in <b>Step 5</b>. The ToTPP contains a DirectShow video patch that allows Indeo playback with more modern filters; the obsolete Indeo 5 codec is not required. If you already have DirectShow filters installed on your system, we're done here. If not, you'll need to grab some. Any of the following codec/filter packs should do the job:</p>
					<ul class="totmenu">
					  <li><p><a href="http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/">ffdshow</a> Last updated 17/07/2014. (<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/software/ffdshow">VideoHelp page</a>)</p></li>
					  <li><p><a href="http://www.cccp-project.net/">The Combined Community Codec Pack (CCCP)</a> Last updated 18/10/2015. (<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/software/Combined-Community-Codec-Pack">VideoHelp page</a>)</p></li>
					  <li><p><a href="http://codecguide.com/">K-Lite Codec Pack</a> Regularly updated. (As you work through the installation wizard, be watchful for bundled crapware and <b>Decline</b> any offers. Under <b>Additional Tasks and Options</b>, scroll to the bottom of the list and deselect <b>Visit a website with codec news</b>.) (<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/software/K-Lite-Codec-Pack">VideoHelp page</a>)</p></li>
					  <li><p><a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/directshow_filterpack.htm">DirectShow FilterPack</a> Last updated 04/03/2012.</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>You may need to right-click the installer files and select <b>Run as administrator</b>.</p></li>
					<li><p><b>Solution 2:</b> The Indeo 5 codec may already be installed on the system, but not registered. If you have a 32-bit version of Windows, look in your Windows\System32 folder for a file called <b>ir50_32.dll</b>. For 64-bit versions of Windows, check your Windows\SysWOW64 folder. If it's not there, try one of the other solutions.</p>			  
					<p>If it <i>is</i> there, you can register it to enable it. This is typically not required for Windows XP, but from Windows Vista onwards, Microsoft <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2521826/malware-vulnerabilities/rather-than-patch--microsoft-blocks-buggy-code.html">ceased support for the Indeo codecs</a>, and they were disabled for <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/954157">security reasons</a>. Use at own risk, I suppose. Run the Command Prompt as an administrator by typing CMD in the Search box (Start button), and then holding Ctrl+Shift and hitting Enter. For 32-bit operating systems, type the following and hit Enter:</p>
					<blockquote class="textblock">regsvr32 ir50_32.dll</blockquote>
					<p>For 64-bit operating systems, type the following and hit Enter:</p>
					<blockquote class="textblock">regsvr32 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ir50_32.dll</blockquote>
					<p>assuming that the operating system is installed on C: drive.</p></li>
					<li><p><b>Solution 3:</b> Install the <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/indeo_codec.htm">Ligos Indeo Codec v5.11</a>. The pack includes versions 3.2, 4.1 (required for earlier versions of Civilization 2) and 5.1 of the codec. The installer is ancient (27/05/2004); it spends an age searching your machine for Netscape Navigator. See security note in <b>Solution 2</b>.</p>
					<p>You may need to right-click the installer file and select <b>Run as administrator</b>.</li>

          <h3>Step 7. Videos from the Test of Time CD-ROM (Optional)</h3>
        </div>
		<p>ToT's in-game videos are found on the installation CD-ROM. If you're using a no-CD patch (eg, <b>Step 5</b>) and you wish to view these videos during play without having to insert the disc, locate the Video folder on the CD-ROM (\Civ2\Video) and copy it to your main Test of Time folder. If you have the ToTPP's DirectShow video patch enabled, you can disable the intro movies from the main ToT menu: <b>TOTPP Configuration</b> &#8594; <b>Video settings</b> &#8594; <b>Disable intro movies</b>. Otherwise, delete or rename the files, tot-go2.avi and intro-scene12.avi.</p>

          <li><p>Make sure you <b>save your games in the correct folder</b>: Original games go in the Original folder, Extended Original games in the ExtendedOriginal folder, Fantasy games in the Fantasy folder, etc. If you switch game type, double check when you hit <b>Save Game</b> (Ctrl+S) that you're not saving your game in the folder for the previous game type. <b>Never</b> save your games in the main Test of Time folder.</p></li>
          <li><p>If you prefer the classic style of city management screen, you can use the <b>City Layout</b> toggle in the <b>View</b> menu to switch interfaces. Similarly, the <b>Map Layout</b> toggle switches between the horizontal and the classic vertical position of the status bar.</p></li>
          <li><p>If you disable the in-game <b>Sound Effects</b> under <b>Game Options</b> (Ctrl+O), videos will also be disabled. If you prefer to play the game without sound, and retain video playback, try muting the game's sound with your audio driver software, eg, with Realtek's High Definition Audio Volume Mixer, sounds can be muted for specific applications. If you can't find it, type SndVol.exe in the Search box in the <b>Start Menu</b>.</p></li>
