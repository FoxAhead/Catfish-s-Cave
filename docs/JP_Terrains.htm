<p><font face="Arial">If there's one thing I couldn't stand about Test of Time, it was the default 
graphics. They are actually worse than the 8-bit graphics of the original game! 
The most obvious graphics in the game are the terrains and the default ones had 
to go! Here, I have an assortment of 24-bit terrains for Test of Time (which, by 
the way, renders its graphics in 16-bit colour - although this is effectively 
reduced to 15-bit, since 1 bit appears to be reserved for non-visible masks). Some terrains are made by me, some 
modified by me and some created by others (see the Readme files in the zips for 
details). </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial">After reading 
<a href="http://apolyton.net/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=107583">this thread</a> 
about&nbsp; terrain tiling in Civ2 
by Mercator 
over at Apolyton and 
then trying it out myself, I decided to update the bulk of my terrains to this 
format. It will effectively remove the slight overlap of adjacent tiles. The 
improvement is most noticeable for roads and railroads.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Original Game Replacements</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This download contains replacement files for the Original game's Terrain1.bmp 
and Terrain2.bmp. I'm starting to think my trees are getting a bit old; I may consider 
&quot;upgrading&quot; them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This is a  compilation of 24-bit&nbsp; terrains for Test of Time. 
Some have been released elsewhere, but many of the terrains here have been since tweaked 
for better tiling. The screenshot, below, shows a few terrains that I did for Curt Sibling's Bitterfrost scenario for Test of Time (<a href="http://apolyton.net/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=100080">still in development</a>). They're now in the collection.</font></p>
