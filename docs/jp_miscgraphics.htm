          <h3>Graphics Mod Pack for the Original Game*</h3>
        </div>
        <p>For those people who think that Test of Time's default graphics are too dark, indistinct and well, just plain ugly (like I do), here's an alternative. The pack contains many of my previously released 24-bit colour terrain graphics, as well as animated terrain resources and team colour masks (thanks to Mercator's <a href="http://civ2.mercator.fastmail.fm/mapedit/downloads.html#file0007">CivSprite</a> and <a href="http://civ2.mercator.fastmail.fm/mapedit/downloads.html#file0008">SpriteGen</a> utilities), plus units and cities art by Fairline and Curt Sibling.</p>

          <h3>Graphics Mod Pack for the ToT Conversion of Bernd Brosing's Imperium Romanum Scenario*</h3>
        </div>
        <p>This is an unofficial graphics modification for the Test of Time version of Bernd Brosing's classic Imperium Romanum scenario. In 2006, prolific Civ2 icon artist Fairline created a set of units for the converted scenario and posted his own <a href="http://apolyton.net/showthread.php/148522-New-ToT-gfx-for-Imperium-Romanum">graphics modpack</a> in the old Scenario League forum. I'd played this scenario some years earlier using a different terrain set and this download was a mixture of those early graphics, Fairline's units, Curt Sibling's cities and people, and a more recent selection of terrain graphics. In 2013, Fairline released a second <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showpost.php?p=12334739&amp;postcount=29">graphics modpack</a> for the scenario. It included new units, cities and people. With his permission, this pack has been updated with these graphics. This modpack requires the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=12464">original ToT conversion</a>.</p>

          <h3>Graphics Mod Pack for Techumseh's Operation Market Garden Scenario*</h3>
        </div>
        <p>This is a graphics modification for Techumseh's World War II scenario about the Allies' failed plan to secure bridges in the Netherlands as far north as the Rhine in late-1944. It remains today the largest airborne operation in history. I played this scenario back in 2004 and, as I almost always do, ended up changing the graphics at the same time, particularly the terrain and cities. The modification retains most of the original units, but some have been replaced with more recent icons. This pack is unofficial; it was only ever intended for personal use, but over the years there have been some requests for it - so here it is. The scenario suffers from the sprite problem that seems to plague ToT scenarios. This is fixed in the pack. You can download the original scenario in its entirety <a href="http://sleague.civfanatics.com/index.php?title=Operation_Market_Garden">here</a>.</p>

        <p>This is a set of replacement graphics for Test of Time's User Interface. The set I was using previously was starting to get a bit old, so I thought it was time for a change. The pack replaces the game's trim, buttons, checkboxes and background textures.</p>

        <p>After giving the demo of Rise of Nations a run, <i>naturally</i> I rummaged through the graphical resources to find its enormous suite of UI icons. With a bit of stretching, they came out quite nicely for use with Test of Time. I have over 400 of these on my hard disk - that's a bit hefty for this site so I've culled it down to 210. Examples below.</p>
