        <h1>Ha! Fooled ya!</h1>

        <p>I've worked on a few scenarios over the years, although it seems my record for completion is pretty piss poor to say the least. There are a couple under construction which have received my intermittent attention in recent times. The screenshot below is taken from a modern Jihad scenario which is currently on hold (since late 2003). I was making decent progress until I decided I wanted to redo the map from scratch and implement an alternative tech tree. It's also currently taking a backseat to War of the Ring - and to be honest, I think I've had more than a gut-full of this part of the world over the past year. The infantry and commando (invisible flag = translucent) units come courtesy of Balou who gave me permission to convert his Civ3 units over to the ToT format.</p>

        <h3>War of the Ring</h3>

        <p>Here are some screenshots from a scenario that I began back in early 2000: War of the Ring. This project came about after working with Harlan Thompson on a revamped and bug-fixed version of his Lord of the Rings scenario for Civ2: Fantastic Worlds. After evaluating the merits of ToT over older versions of the game, Harlan, who had 'retired' from Civ2 at this stage, lost interest in the FW version and persuaded me to make a new Lord of the Rings scenario for ToT. I worked on it for a few months, with Harlan acting in an advisory role. After a break of several months, I briefly revived it in late 2000 before shelving it indefinitely. It may eventually see the light of day. It's a 4-map single-player scenario. Harlan, Techumseh and Boco have, at various times, made significant contributions to the project.</p>

        <p>I started the scenario again from scratch in early 2004, this time replacing my old 18 250-tile gigamap with a much larger one (which I've had sitting on my hard disk for a few years). Below is a zoomed out in-game shot (reduced 50%) of my 32 725-tile gigamap of Middle-earth. I'm much more satisfied with this map, due both to its size and the level of horizontal compression. Horizontal compression? The screenshot may look wider than Tolkien's original Middle-earth map, but in fact the ratio of horizontal to vertical <i>tile</i> distances is less than 1. The apparent widening is due to the 2:1 width to height ratio of the game tiles. Maps which maintain a 1:1 tile ratio usually appear badly stretched horizontally in the game map due to this fact (obviously the mini-map is fine) and Middle-earth was no exception. This map is basically a trade-off between aesthetics and maintaining accurate horizontal tile distances.</p>

        <p>The  screenshots following are from what could be termed an alpha version of the scenario. The unit placement in the first screenshot is staged. The city sizes are unconfirmed. City graphics are by Favoured Flight.</p>

        <p>Oh crap! The consequences of the Ring-bearer's failure to leave home. Sorting the Nazgûl AI has proven to be a real pain. Role 0 domain 3 is the favoured option; it displays the same AI as role 0 ground units and cannot occupy enemy cities. Role 0 air units have a nasty habit of selecting targets on the other side of the map, especially if they are also air units. The main drawback is that domain 3 units are unaffected by SAMs or the x4 vs air units flag. The screenshot also illustrates the importance of city walls. In this example, Hobbiton's population dropped by 3 in a single turn - a hefty blow in a scenario with no settler units.</p>

        <p>The High Pass: two transport sites provide access to a secondary map, the contents of which shall remain a mystery (Note: mountains are impassable terrain). Although the High Pass was kept open by Grimbeorn and his Beornings, it was watched by agents of the Enemy.</p>

        <p>'Mr Frodo, I think we're in heap big heap shit!'</p>
        <p>'No Sam, <i>you</i> are. Remember, I can outrun you any day.'</p>

        <p>An encounter possibility. The left screenshot shows a version of Shelob's Lair - but not the version found in the game. Entry requires the assistance of Gollum. The picture to the right shows Aragorn and Boromir in the Moria tileset. 'To the bridge!' Why? It's got a good defensive bonus, of course.</p>

        <p>I thought I'd throw in a couple of screenshots showing some of the trigger areas in the secondary maps; the first being Lórien which provides the Fellowship player with a free unit upgrade (Leonardo's Workshop) and boats for the Quest. The second is of Frodo destroying the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. It would've been nice to have been able to include Gollum in the mix here, but the number of contingencies required would mean an overburdening of the events' memory resources. He <i>is</i> however essential for navigating Cirith Ungol.</p>

        <p>The City Information screen, shown at two-thirds the original size.</p>

        <p><img src="images/WotR_CityScreen.png" width="650" height="452" alt="City Screen Screenshot"></p>

        <p>The Civilization Advances screen. Icons are from Rise of Nations, BeBro and yours truely.</p>

        <p>The Defence Minister screen. Background image is from the movie Return of the King; the scenario uses a custom tiles.dll file.</p>

        <p>Yeah, so I'm getting carried away here - nobody reads this crap anyway. Below is a screenshot from the Game Concepts section of the Civilopedia. It shows part of a working list of events responsible for shaping the behaviour of your main AI opponents. These make use of Test of Time's flag threshold mask.</p>
